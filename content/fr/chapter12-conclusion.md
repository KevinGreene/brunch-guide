# Conclusion

And to think this whole guide was originally supposed to be a reasonably short article (say, 5–6 hours of writing)…  Ha ha ha!  But then I kept thinking “Oh dang, I've got to mention this and that too!”

I hope you **enjoyed this guide**, and more importantly that it **tentalized you to try out Brunch** instead of your usual build tool, because in the vast majority of situations, it'll be **simpler, faster, and overall nicer!**

This guide is not entirely comprehensive: it doesn't explain all possible plugin situations, all types of module wrappings, etc.  But it does try to give you a good, solid understaning of Brunch, why it works the way it does, and how that makes it great.

Remember: if you want to extend this, just [contribute](README.md#contributing)!

Cheers!
